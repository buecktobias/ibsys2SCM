```
ðŸ“š /book
  â”œâ”€â”€ GET      â†’ List all books
  â”œâ”€â”€ POST     â†’ Create book
  â””â”€â”€ /{id}
      â”œâ”€â”€ GET  â†’ Retrieve one
      â”œâ”€â”€ PUT  â†’ Update
      â””â”€â”€ DELETE â†’ Delete

ðŸ‘¤ /author
  â”œâ”€â”€ GET      â†’ List all authors
  â”œâ”€â”€ POST     â†’ Create author
  â””â”€â”€ /{id}
      â”œâ”€â”€ GET  â†’ Retrieve one
      â””â”€â”€ DELETE â†’ Delete
```

Super intuitive, no clutter, and easy to extend.
